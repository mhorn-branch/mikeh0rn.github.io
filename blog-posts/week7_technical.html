				<h3 align="center">October 10, 2014</h3>
				<h5 align="center"><p>Compare SQL databases with NoSQL databases. What are the pros and cons of either? Which are you most excited to work with and why?</p>



<p>Today's blog post is going to be about comparing SQL databases with NoSQL databases and the pros and cons of both. SQL (a relational database) has been the primary model for database management for quite some time. More presently, there has been a shift to NoSQL databases (non-relational) in the world of database management.</p>

<p>SQL stands for Structured Query Language and it is used to manage, store, and retrieve data in relational databases. An SQL server consists of sets of tables with predefined columns (i.e. names, emails, phone numbers, favorite dog type, etc.). SQL databases are considered to be "old school" since it has been in practice as the go-to structured database format for such a long time. NoSQL (short for 'Not Only SQL') takes unstructured data and stores it in a NoSQL database and unlike SQL, it does not require a fixed table schema and avoids JOIN operations. </p>

<p>When weighing the pros and cons of both, it must be recognized that NoSQL databases exist to deal with extremely large amounts of data. While the benefits of SQL are that it is very organized and well-structured, it can be simutaneously viewed as a shortcoming. As data volume increases within SQL databases, performance decreases. NoSQL databases can simply handle more data with little reduction in performance.</p>

<p>More benefits of NoSQL databases - they require less management. Features of NoSQL databases allow for more automation features to fix and distribute data and fine-tuning is far less expensive than that of an SQL database due to its unstructured nature.</p>

<p>On the flipside, NoSQL databases do have their cons...</p>
<p>There is much less appeal to bigger corporations due to the fact that the customer support that exists for SQL databases simply does not exist for NoSQL databases. It is far less mainstream and lacks credibility for conservative companies who would much prefer to be safe than sorry. While this may be subjective, my research suggests that coding an SQL query is far easier due to its structured nature while NoSQL queries can be a bit of a headache from a coding standpoint for even the simplest of tasks. In other words, writing a NoSQL query takes a fair amount of programming experience.</p>

<p>Based on my research, I think due to my organized nature, I am more looking forward to working with a database that is more structured like an SQL database. My opinions may change over time but I feel more confident picking up SQL until I have enough SQL and programming experience to fully grasp the day-to-day benefits of using a NoSQL database. As a beginner, I want to stick with getting my feet wet in structured database management first before switching over to something I can't fully understand yet.</p>
