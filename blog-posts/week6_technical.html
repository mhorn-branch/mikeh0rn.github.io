				<h3 align="center">October 1, 2014</h3>
				<h5 align="center"><p>Describe and explain the purposes of classes and modules. How are they similar? How do they compare?</p>



<p>Today's blog post is going to be about Classes vs. Modules and explain the purpose of each, how they are similar and how they differentiate from one another. In short, a Class is a template to create objects. It allows us to combine variables and objects together so that we can ultimately create instances of the Class. To break this down even further, the main purpose of a Class is to be able to group items together.  When creating a program, you want to identify the things your program is going to deal with and based on what objects you need, you'll create Classes to hold and initialize them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we have Modules. What is a module, what does it do and how does it truly diffentiate itself from a Class? I ask myself this question every morning before I get out of bed. But seriously, a Module, in short, is a conglomeration of related methods that group similar things. Module and Classes are similar in how they both hold methods and from a coding perspective, they are defined in an almost identical manner. However, a Class is created for objects while a Module is created for functions. The limitations with Modules is that you can't create objects based on them and you also can't subclass them the way you can with Classes. All of that being said, the key takeaway of their difference is that you can take a Ruby Module and add its function to a Ruby Class but not the other way around.</p>

<p>With regards to how a Module operates, it's important to note that unlike Classes, you can't call a method you create in a module the same way because you can't create instances of a Module. In order to access the method of a Mofule outside of the Module, you must use .self to create a module method. This way, when you call it outside the module, all you need to do is say ModuleName.method_name. </p>
