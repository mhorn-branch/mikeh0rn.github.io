                    <h2>10/1/14: Stereotype Threat</h2>

                <p>This was a very interesting and topic that hit close to home especially since first applying to Dev Bootcamp and considering quitting my job to become a full-time programmer back in March. For some background- I've been flip flopping with careers since I graduated college 7 years ago and all of my jobs have been primarily in Marketing. I was able to steer off into coding land (HTML and CSS) by working in Email Marketing but I've been in a very unsatisfying and unfulfilling industry for a few years now. When I think about where I've been and where I'm trying to be (in terms of trying to become a programmer), the first thought is simply being a white male in a sea of....well, other white men. It may sound funny at first thought but in actuality, it's rather petrifying. A reasonable comparison is like being a Canadian Hockey player. Not only am I a white male in an industry filled with more people just like me but I'm a white male with a beard from NYC who looks like a hipster, plays music, collects vinyl records and wears big headphones while he works. Again, all of this may seem humorous but they are things I could see someone else judging me for from the outside looking in mainly because I've certainly felt it myself. I'm currently feeling it right now everyday even if it's just internal. I find that this an identity threat simply because there are so many carbon copies of people who look like me with the same goals that at times it makes me feel like "just another white guy who wants to be a programmer" and even worse- if I'm not an incredible programmer, I'm going to be extremely frowned up. This takes a toll and can be mental warfare a lot of times. If anything it can affect my achievement in a negative manner because it's easy to get distracted by the anxiety that comes on when pondering these things.</p>
<p>
With regards to a stereotype threat, I can think as far back as 9th grade to where I first started to feel affected by any feelings of a stereotype threat. On a nationality/religious level, I've been in a circle of Jewish friends for the duration of my life. I was surrounded by your stereotypical future doctors, lawyers, accountants, etc. I had to deal with a circle of friends who would compare grades after each test to where it became a real ego killer. I'd sit and ask myself "well, I'm part Jewish and everyone assumes I must become XYZ so I guess I need to become XYZ." I think similarly to my identity threat feelings, this started to affect my thinking of what if I became anything less than what the typical Jewish white male becomes. This is really threatening to your own ego and causes a lot of unwanted anxiety. I find that because of that time period, my own identity has been sculpted and altered to where I ask myself if I'm good enough constantly.</p>
