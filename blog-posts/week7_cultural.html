				<h3 align="center">October 10, 2014</h3>
				<h5 align="center"><p>I've decided to chose the values of Accomplishment and Knowledge. With regards to Accomplishment, I feel this is one that most driven people would rank highly or even the highest in terms of their values. Accomplishment gives people a sense of security and in many ways, connects to so many other values. The feeling of accomplishment to me is knowing that something I set out to do was done and done correctly. It's quite simple to make a goal for yourself but in order to actually set out and complete that goal to give yourself a sense of accomplishment - in my eyes there are few better feelings that you can feel. Driven people seek to feel accomplished and to reach their goals to their maximum capacity. It contributes to mood and momentum needed to build on a skill.</p>
<p>
I chose knowledge as another key value since I think it is very similar to accomplishment. Feeling knowledgeable about something can lead to feeling accomplishment and can also control mood and momentum as well. I always find that I gain accomplishment through knowledge in that gaining knowledge has always inspired me to become a mentor to others who are in a place or position I was once in. Knowledge allows us to relate to other people less knowledge on a topic in order to inspire them to meet their goals. Similarly to accomplishment, there are few better feelings to me than being knowledgeable. Afterall, knowledge is power.</p>

<p>As far as values in my life, generally speaking I try to live by the values provided to us in Exercise 1. I would have to give it a 5.</p>

<p>A topic that I am typically asked advice on is career path. It's very interesting that I have been in a constant flux in my career for the past 7 years out of college and 23-24 year olds ask my advice constantly on how I got to this point. I have many former employees from my past company whom I managed in the who look to me for advice on what they should do next and how I went about making my decisions. I would say that people typically look to me for wisdom since I am a few years ahead of the game and have been through a lot in a short time. I think it's typical to look up to someone a few years older than you to gain insight about what to expect in the coming years. Learning from others who are older and wiser are what allow us to formulate our own decisions about life. This is why I feel so many people are heavily influenced by parental advice and teachers at a young age.</p>

<p>I consider myself someone with very strong morals and values. I like to think that typically I do the right thing and I have a good mental and emotional trigger that allows me to sense when something is wrong in the room. I feel really good about my values when I consider the list of them that has been presented to us in this exercise. I think staying true to my values will absolutely allow me to mediate sterotype threat if I feel it at DBC. Sometimes relying on your values is the best insight you have when you're put in a situation where you have nowhere else to turn to in the moment. I think being able to meditate and take walks whenever I'm feeling down will be beneficial to me. I already practice these methods during Phase 0 and think I will continue to follow them in the coming weeks.</p>
