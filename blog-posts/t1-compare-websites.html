				<h5 align="center">My three websites of focus for this analysis are Seamless, PayPal, and Thrillist. Although I am sure you all have heard of these sites, here are brief descriptions: Seamless is a website that creates an easy and enjoyable way for the user to search for, browse through, and order from different restaurant menus. PayPal is a site that enables users to pay for goods and services in a safe and efficient way. Finally, Thrillist is a site that blends men's shopping experiences with interesting articles and geotargeted recommendations.
            While these sites are all unique in their purpose, each incorporates site design best practices in their layout, content, and authenticity. For layout, a priority is creating a site that is easy to navigate and obtain information quickly. More than that, however, it means ensuring that this seamless experience carries over from desktop to mobile. These sites accomplish this. For instance, the top navigation buttons on the sites are clear and uncluttered. Both PayPal and Seamless have only four different CTAs across the top navigation, with Thrillist trailing behind with five. Minimizing the number of buttons in a navigation bar ensures that the sites are touch-friendly, not just cursor-friendly. In addition, the layout of each site's content is reflective of the purpose of the site. On Seamless, for instance, the eye is immediately drawn to the site's statement, "Order food delivery from your favorite local restaurants." When you step back, you notice the search bar immediately to the right, which asks you to enter in your email to get started. This straightforward and minimalist design marries well with its hungry users who are likely not interested in digging through extra content to get started on their search for their next meal. Thrillist, alternatively, is a site that one goes to for local recommendations and interesting articles. One may find him or herself searching for something out of boredom or simply looking for a headline that catches his or her attention. The site's layout, with its image-centric content and endless scrolling encourages the user to explore.
            Content encompasses many aspects within site design, including creating immersive experiences, and simplifying, and driving a consumer-centric journey. My favorite example of creating an immersive experience is the homepage of the PayPal site. As soon as you land on the page, a short video clip beings to play, with an overlay of various taglines (depending on which video is playing) that include, "Halfsies a whole lot easier" or "The check's in the email." Immediately below are highly relevant CTAs such as, "Send Money Now," or "Start Emailing Your Invoices." The taglines are in a thin, white font with the CTA contained in a curved light blue box. The feelings I get from watching these videos are harmony, happiness, and curiosity. The videos draw one into the site, and the light feeling one experiences from the headlines and CTAs take the user deeper into the stories other users are creating by using PayPal.
            A site that simplifies is Seamless. Type in your email address, use the sidebar filters to customize your results based on things like type of cuisine, restaurant rating, and price, pick a place and browse the menu, and order. Each restaurant menu follows and standardized layout, and all information that may be pertinent to your order, including minimum order amount and delivery time estimate, is always included and in the same location on the page. Seamless content is practical, efficient, and easy. Like its name suggests, the predictable content structure makes ordering your food almost as good as the food itself (almost).
            Driving a consumer-centric journey is Thrillist's specialty. It all begins with asking the user to input his or her location. From there, the site draws users in with its enticing images and quirky headlines. When one scrolls over an image, social stats appear, including the number of views and the number of shares that particular article received. These small details create a feeling like one is a part of a larger community, and subtly encourages users to participate further on the site. While getting users to shop may be Thrillist's goal, the content is written in such a way that promoted articles do not feel 'promotional,' which establishes a consumer's trust with the brand.
            Finally, what these three sites have in common is authenticity. What I mean by authenticity is that when I go onto these sites, I feel like each has a unique voice that is talking to me as if I were a friend that was visiting, rather than another anonymous user. The images and video avoid stock photos, the content is well written and engaging, and the brand voice has its own flavor and personality. For instance, despite PayPal being a larger and corporate-sounding brand, the site itself stays away from corporate speak and instead takes on a conversational tone with the end user. When I design websites, I want to be conscious of these best practices, while keeping in mind that the most important aspect of creating a great site is understanding who will be using the site and why. If I recognize this, I can create an experience using a layout, content and tone that uniquely tailors to their needs.</h5>
