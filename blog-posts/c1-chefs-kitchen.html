                    <h2>8/31/14: Chefs in the Kitchen</h2>

                    <p>Based on the Fireside Chat with Shereef, my take on the DBC experience is that it is (if nothing else) upfront and completely open and honest about all of the challenges we'll entail on a day-to-day basis. The thing I enjoy most about Shareef is how down to earth he is in terms of how the experience and the vulnerabily in admitting the need to constantly improve the program (i.e. seeking feedback from students). I think his attitude is planted across DBC to allow it to become what it has become. I see similar traits in myself that I see with Shareef. I find it extremely difficult at times seeing myself want to embrace aspects of DBC where I feel either exposed and/or a high level of anxiety. That being said, I do see the small light at the end of the tunnel where embracing the culture will be beneficial to both me and the people in my cohort. I see DBC as learning to tie a tie. In the beginning you're nervous about the challenge of simply not knowing but by a few days or weeks in, if you believe in the process and follow it, it will feel completely natural. I knew getting into this process that this was going to be so much more about an experience than just learning code. If it were only about coding, I wouldn't have chosen DBC as my top choice from the beginning. It's all about trusting the process and that I definitely do - even moreso after this video. I will say not much has changed in terms of my expectations. From day 1, I knew exactly what I was getting myself into especially after reading so many blogs from those who have already gone through it. I have been weighing making a decision like this for the past 2 years and now that I have, I feel extremely rejuvented and excited (but also frightened) to go ALL-IN at DBC. I'm in my 7th day of Phase 0 so it's safe to say I'm pretty much nervous about everything right now but as I mentioned before, I can see the light at the end of the tunnel and that alone is more of a breath of fresh air than I've ever felt in my professional career.</p>
