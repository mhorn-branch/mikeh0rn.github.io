                    <h2>9/13/14: My experience in Phase 0 to this point</h2>

                   <p>I think what has been the biggest struggle for me at Phase 0 so far is spending countless hours trying to solve one problem when I get stuck. It's been genetically built in me as a student and a worker that in order to move onto the next problem, I need to solve the one I'm currently on. What I'm learning very quickly is that most of the time, it's far more important to cap an amount of time I spend on something and if I don't reach my goals, I need to table it until I have a fresh mind or additional sleep. There have been some very late nights so far filled with frustration and roadblocks especially, this week. I think the issues I've been running into are partially related to my learning style and partially related to getting used to working mostly on my own, remotely and with deadlines set. When I come across a problem, I tend to want to solve it and beat it until the ground until all my energy is used up on it. It's poor practice and I recognize it. While I write this blog, I am still not finished with Challenges 5 and 6 but know that in order for me to properly finish all the coursework effectively for week 3, I need to learn to table challenges and come back to them late.</p>
				<p>My thinking styles are Concrete Sequential and Abstract Random. I really think in order for me to benefit myself and continue to exercise my brain, the best thing I could do is continue to learn best practices and practice best ways to meditate and create habits (as we examined in week 2). I spent lots of time using the pomodoro timer this week in order to get myself into a rhythm where I'm not sitting in front of my computer for 8-10 hours a day going in spurts of "aha" moments and giving my screen a complete blank stare as I pull my hair out of my head. Giving myself breaks and moments to rest help give me some perspective and allow me to address problems I was dealing with with a fresh mind.  Most times, I am able to get myself back to the ground level to re-address what my problem was and what next steps I'll take to address it. If I haven't come to a good resolution, I take a step back altogether and move onto a different problem. Continuing to keep these new habits in tact will benefit my ability to think with a fresh mind to help myself grow to become a better programmer and give myself a strong mentality to complete the work efficiently.</p>
				<p>Now, consider the idea of growth vs. fixed mindset. Part of knowing about your thinking styles is to know what you need to learn effectively, but we also want to encourage you to broaden the ways you learn and think. Our learning and thinking styles can morph and change as we exercise our brains. So think of some ways you can work to expand the ways you learn and think. The more well-rounded you are, the easier it will be to learn quickly and effectively.</p>
