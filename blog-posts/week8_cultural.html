				<h5 align="center"><p>Something that most people can relate to with regards to emotional conflict is dealing with a roommate confrontation. Some months back, I received a text message from my roommate regarding something that was bothering him in the apartment. It was the dishes I left in the sink that were smelling up the kitchen...</p>
<p>
Understandably so, he was annoyed and addressed it in a rather brash manner over text message while I was out at a bar with my girlfriend watching my Alma Mater, UConn, in the national championship basketball game. Due to the context of receiving the criticism over text message and him being well aware of where I was, I got very defensive. It could have been a simple matter discussed in person and it would have been taken a different way but since it was over text, I retaliated about all the things that were snowballing in my mind and making me annoyed in the apartment and ultimately it distracted me from the game and upset me and him.</p>

<p>The source of the conflict was dirty dishes and a passive aggressive text message but I made matters worse by 'Attacking Other.' I think we both handled it in a poor manner and we were both willing to admit that as the conversation went on via text. My actions towards him in the heat of the moment didn't make the situation better and I should have waited to address my feelings about certain topics in person so that I could have avoided sounding like a hypocrite. I wish I could have gone back to say "Hey, I understand you're upset right now and I'm sorry that I can't do anything to fix it or talk right now but let's chat tomorrow when I'm at the apartment." I think recognizing his feelings and frustrations and holding off until I cooled down would have really been beneficial to the conflict.</p>

<p>I hope to approach my conflicts in web development very similarly to how I would approach a real life example such as the one above. Regardless of whether it's a design disagreement or a dirty pile of dishes, taking a moment to recognize where someone might be coming from and putting yourself and their shoes goes a really long way. It's difficult to remove our minds from our own body sometimes and that can get us in trouble. I hope to take this lesson along with me for the rest of my career.</p>
