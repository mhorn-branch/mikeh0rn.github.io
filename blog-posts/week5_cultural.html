                    <h2>9/28/14: Pairing and Giving Feedback</h2>

                <p>Pairing at DBC is a very interesting concept and I think it's the part of programming that is often overlooked in terms of importance. I started at DBC being very nervous about pairing. Not because I have a hard time interacting with people but because I came in with zero programming background and it's very intimidating when so many of your peers have touched upon a lot of this material before. It's very easy to feel inadequate. What I did notice was that everyone's emotional intelligence is very high and they seem to be very understanding of where you feel you are with the material. I am very far from my comfort zone and I'd imagine that's a normal feeling at this stage in the game. Let's hope so anyway... I think with regards to pairing, I actually enjoy pairing more now than I do working on challenges on my own. The reason is I find that when I pair, I'm able to think outloud more and my pair helps me think of things in different ways to approach something. I've made friends and I learn in the process.</p> 
<p>I always find that pairing is fun and rewarding. It makes the challenges less stressful for me and I really look forward to working on these challenges in person for Phase 1 because pairing helps me feel most connected within the program. Working on the die challenges was especially rewarding after going through some trial and error with the driver tests. It's always a great feeling to watch your code fail and after several tries, getting it to pass.</p>
<p>Frustration during Phase 0 is something I deal with daily. What comes to mind is something I've read about frequently in this field and that's imposter syndrome. I'm afraid of not knowing and I'm afraid that the current pace of coursework in running me into the ground. That being said, I'm staying focused and I think I will prevail in the end if I keep my eye on the prize. I find that the Well Grounded Rubyist didn't necessarily make anything easier for me and instead, made me more frustrated. I'm constantly looking for additional resources to assist someone at the beginner level and hope that over the next few weeks, I'm able to solidify some of the concepts I've learned especially in weeks 4 and 5.</p>
<p>
I felt really good about my feedback and I think that typically, I'm harder on myself than other people are on me (which is to be expected). I've been happy with my feedback all-in-all and it has been very valuable in helping me grow in DBC. The feedback is helpful to my learning because if nothing else, it's inspiring. I don't always walk away reading my feedback feeling like I know exactly what I did right or wrong or what I can improve but it makes me feel better about what I'm capable of doing or not doing and how other people perceive my approach. That's the key above all. I think I know where I can improve and I will definitely seek out as many additional resources as possible to make sure I am more effective in my pairing sessions.
As far as writing feedback goes, it is very natural for me to write feedback since I've liked working with all of my pairs and always feel like I take something away from them. Communication is a strength for me. Afterall, I was a communication major...
That being said, the part that's most difficult to identify is where your pair can improve. We spend so much time thinking about how we personally can improve that it's not always so easy to figure out how someone else can improve their own skills. This is something I will definitely work on as well.</p>
