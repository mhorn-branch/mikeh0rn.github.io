                    <h2>10/24/14: How to ask a good question</h2>

                <p>Coming into DBC, Something that I think can be often overlooked is the power of writing a good question both online on the message board or in person from Day 1 and beyond. From a cultural standpoint, it goes a long way to be able to communicate your thoughts and problems as clearly as possible in order to get to the answer you're looking for to solve the issue at hand. Miscommunication of a problem can lead to all the wrong answers and set one back even further.</p>
<p>
Understanding the clarity of what you're asking is very important while communicating in all aspects of your life. Reading through our questions to ensure we're understanding the questions we're asking someone else is key in our development starting in Phase 1 and beyond.</p>

<p>Looking back at an example of a question I asked on the Google+ message board, I can see how little clarity there was due to my moment of panic. I asked "Is there anyone that can help me out in an urgent situation with git? I appear to have taken some poor advice online and don't know how to recover files I was trying to push to git hub." Here it appears I've address the topic (git) I'm running into an issue with but fail to talk about the problem. How someone was supposed to help me in this scenario was beyond me. What ended up happening was that it led to a longer chain of about 10 posts to get to the heart of what the issue was in order for someone to begin communicating a solution.</p>

<p>In hindsight, I could have specific a little more about my problem to come to a solution quickly. I could have also addressed what I had already done that my files suddenly dissappeared. It was poor practice to not state the problem or specify what I was trying to accomplish from the start.</p>
