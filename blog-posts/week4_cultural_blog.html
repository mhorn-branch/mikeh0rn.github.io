				<h3 align="center">September 21, 2014</h3>
				<h5 align="center"><p>A problem I've researched in the tech industry and one that I know hits close to home at DBC is the issue of the gender gap in the tech industry. From a male perspective, it's very easy to overlook a problem that doesn't affect you directly but after reading some of the articles I've listed in my blog post, I am definitely now much more culturally aware on the topic and more sensitive to it.</p>
<p>
My understanding of the general issue is that there simply aren't enough women in tech. For the women who are in the tech industry, they tend to feel extremely outnumbered and far outside of their comfort zone and want to fit in. Understandable that anyone would want to fit into their work place. According to Claire Cain Miller in the article, "Technology’s Man Problem", she states that, "Many women who want to be engineers encounter a field where they not only are significantly underrepresented but also feel pushed away." In a time where the tech industry is in a boom of constantly needing more software engineers and encourages our generation to do so, it seems that women are being pushed away both consciously and subconciously because of what the industry is so used to doing, seeing, and how non-reactive. </p>

<p>
The question arises of how we can fix this imbalance. According to RapidMiner COO, Michelle Chambers, she stated, "there are still challenges for women looking to move into leadership roles in the technology world because of a lot of “old school” perceptions still held by men—and sometimes accepted by some women. “If you live within the constraints that somebody sets for you, then that becomes your problem...”</p>

<p>
The problem needs to be recognized on multiple fronts - one that needs to be recognized by the industry, the employers themselves to make adjustments in the workplace to increase gender diversity and lastly, the gender contributing to the issues (male figures in the industry) need to act as the faciliator to encourage a diversity uptick and to speak openly to help women fit in like anyone else with the same level of expertise. The groundwork for media recognizing the problem is a first step in the right direction and think now it will become more of the norm for gender balance in tech.</p>
