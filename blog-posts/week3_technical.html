				<h3 align="center">September 13, 2014</h3>
				<h5 align="center"><p>I believe JavaScript's popularity in web development has a direct correlation between how it is able to work hand in hand easily with HTML and CSS. Through the Document Object Model, JavaScript can manipulate all of the HTML and CSS elements and attributes in a page. From the challenges this week, I've noticed there is also so much flexibility you have in being able to create objects that include functions locally as well as being able to create functions globally (outside of the object) that can be called in any part of the code. This was also portrayed through using the Code Combat training. Using it hands on was able to shed some light on how small functions in javascript can go a long way in building out a program.</p>

<p>From some additional research, the limitations I've come to learn are that JavaScripts abilities largely depend on the browser it is being run on. What I mean by that is that all browsers interpret JavaScript differently so as a result, there needs to be lots of testing between all browsers prior to completing the final product. I noticed this to be true when I used Google Chrome and Firefox when using Code Combat and the site had stalled on Chrome many times while on Firefox, it worked smoothly at all times.</p>

<p>I see the benefits of using JavaScript even though I find it to be very challenging. My understanding is that jQuery exists to simplify writing JavaScript with how long-winded it can be at times. I look forward to diving even more into JavaScript and learn the inner workings to be able to pickup jQuery a lot easier.</p></h5>
