                    <h2>9/7/14: Classes vs. IDs</h2>

                    <p>Let's break down the difference between classes and ids and then get into best practices associated with them. Classes and IDs are items that get assigned to HTML elements in order to be able to apply styling and changes to either one or many items. This may seem confusing but the easy thing to remember is that a class can be applied to many things and an ID can be applied to just ONE thing. While we have the ability to style an HTML element in CSS without a class and ID, most of the time we'll add a class or ID to make our lives easier down the road. Not only will it cut down on time if a change needs to be made but it's good to keep classifying these items separately from the HTML for organizational purposes. </p>
					<p>As I've mentioned previously, an ID is only to be used once to style ONE element. Why would anyone need to do this when you could easily just style any HTML element without an ID? Well, there is an answer to that. When you have a bunch of children elements under a parent and you have a style you want to apply to ALL of them? For that, you'd set a class on it and style it in the CSS. Now let's say that for whatever reason you want to style just 1 element to be different from the group of elements that you already styled in the CSS. To do this, the ID is your answer. You would set an ID on that HTML element equal to whatever you want and voila! You can now style just that ONE element in the CSS. In comparison, the beauty of using a class is that if you set that class equal to an HTML element and style it with a blue font but want to change it to a red font, you can very easily. Remember that a class can be applied as many times as you want and it will change all the elements associated with it. One you change it from blue to red in your CSS, everything is now changed.</p><p>Here's a great resource I found on the topic: <a href="http://www.iraqtimeline.com/maxdesign/basicdesign/principles/princlass.html">http://www.iraqtimeline.com/maxdesign/basicdesign/principles/princlass.html</a></p>
