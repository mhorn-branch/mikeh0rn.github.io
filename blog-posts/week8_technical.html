                    <h2>10/18/14: What is Rails?</h2>


<p>Simply put, Rails is an open source web app framework for creating database driven websites in Ruby. The beauty of it is that it is a full-stack framework and it covers both front and back end design. The ultimate intention of Ruby of Rails is to include tools that make web development tasks easier. </p>

<p>Ruby on Rails was built so that you're able to accomplish complex tasks with less and better structured code. I'm sure it goes without says that Rails is built on Ruby (hence, Ruby on Rails) and is meant to make life a bit easier as a developer where there are so many tasks at hand. Rails reduces that by including a range of plugins that cut down on development time so that YOU as a developer can focus on the good stuff.</p>

<p>Rails is used primarily to build a complex website or app that uses a database. PHP is another alternative for this if you want to add basic functionality but if you're going the complex route, Rails is the way to go because of what the framework can handle. It is the fastest and most efficient way to build web apps and there is a large demand for RoR in the marketplace because of it.</p>
