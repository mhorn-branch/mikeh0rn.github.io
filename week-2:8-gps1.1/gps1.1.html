            <h2>What is Pair Programming?</h2>
            <p>Collaborative problem solving to 
              achieve programming goals through communicating the 
              objective at hand and executing the strategy together.</p>

          <h2>Why is Pair Programming important to DBC?</h2>
          <p>Pair programming is important to DBC because it helps effectively prepare students for 
             teamwork in real life environments. Through effective pair programming 
             we grow and learn together by speaking through problems and collaboratively 
             finding the best strategy to approach all portions of the challenge.

         <article id="compare"> 
        <h2>Compare driver and navigator</h2>
        <p>While the Driver takes lead on the coding and syntax, the Navigator 
           focuses on logic and WHY we are approaching a challenge a certain way. The driver is not meant to 
           be a parrot of the navigator but more of the point person to translate and implement the thoughts 
           of the Nagivator. When necessary, the driver will step in to provide feedback or push back on a particular approach.</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>What was it like to pair for the first time? Did you enjoy it? What worked? What didn't work? Add your reflection to your page and style it as well.</p>
        <p>Pairing was an absolute pleasure, especially with Brian. We were transparent from the start and it really helped us in being able to accomplish our goals together. I think initially when working with someone for the first time, it takes some times to get the engine revved up to get things moving but once you break the ice, pairing is great! I anticipate that when I work with Brian again, we will be able to know how the other works well enough that we will be able to accomplish our goals quickly.</p>
