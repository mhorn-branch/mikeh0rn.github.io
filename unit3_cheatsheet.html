                    <h2><a name="ruby1">Data Types</a></h2>
                    <p>In Ruby, your information (or data) can come in different types. 
                    There are three data types in Ruby that we're interested in right now: 
                    numbers, booleans (which can be true or false), and strings 
                    (words or phrases like "I'm learning Ruby!").
                    <p>Computer programs exist to quickly analyze and manipulate data. 
                    For that reason, it's important for us to understand the different data 
                    types that we can use in our programs.</p>
                    <p>Reminder: never use quotation marks (' or ") with booleans, or Ruby will 
                    think you're talking about a string (a word or phrase) instead of a value 
                    that can be true or false. It's also important to remember that Ruby is 
                    case-sensitive (it cares about capitalization).</p>

                    <h2><a name="ruby2">Variables</a></h2>
                    <p>One of the most basic concepts in computer programming is the variable. 
                    You can think of a variable as a word or name that grasps a single value. 
                    For example, let's say you needed the number 25 from our last example, but 
                    you're not going to use it right away. You can set a variable, say my_num, 
                    to grasp the value 25 and hang onto it for later use, like this:</p>
                    <p>my_num = 25</p>
                    <p>Declaring variables in Ruby is easy: you just write out a name like my_num, 
                    use = to assign it a value, and you're done! If you need to change a variable, 
                    no sweat: just type it again and hit = to assign it a new value.</p>

                    <h2><a name="ruby3">'puts' and 'print'</a></h2>
                    <p>The print command just takes whatever you give it and prints it to the screen. puts (for "put string") is slightly different: it adds a new (blank) line after the thing you want it to print. You use them like this:</p>
                    <p>puts "What's up?"</p>
                    <p>print "Oxnard Montalvo"</p>
                    <p>No parentheses or semicolons needed!</p>

                    <h2><a name="ruby4">Strings and String Methods</a></h2>
                        <p>The '.length' Method</p>
                        <p>Methods are summoned using a .. If you have a string, "I love espresso", and take the .length of it, Ruby will return the length of the string (that is, the number of characters—letters, numbers, spaces, and symbols). Check it out:</p>
                        <p>"I love espresso".length</p>
                        <p># ==> 15</p>
                        <p>(That little line starting with the # isn't part of what you need to write—it just shows you the output Ruby will provide. More on this in the next section!)</p>

                        <p>Taking the length of input can be useful if, for example, you want to make a website that takes credit card payments. Ruby can check to make sure the credit card number appears to be valid.</p>
                        <p>'.upcase' & '.downcase'</p>
                        <p>As you might have guessed, the .upcase and .downcase methods convert a string to ALL UPPER CASE or all lower case, respectively.</p></p>
